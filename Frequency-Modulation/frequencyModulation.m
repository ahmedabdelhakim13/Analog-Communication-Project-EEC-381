    % frequencyModulation performs frequency modulation on an input signal
    % Inputs:
    %   kf: Frequency deviation constant (modulation index)
    %   carrierFreq: Carrier frequency of the modulation
    %   carrierAmp: Amplitude of the carrier signal
    %   signal: Input signal to be modulated
    %   f_Sampling: Sampling frequency of the signal

    % Generate the time vector corresponding to the signal
    startTime = 0;
